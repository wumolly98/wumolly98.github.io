        <h3 align = "center"> My Core Design Values</h3>
        <p>

Designers are responsible for making technology equitable. The key ingredient to designing for other communities is authenticity. And that requires users to be involved in the process through user testing, interviews, focus groups, and evaluation.
            Fearlessness: I am not afraid to learn and work outside of the designer realm. I've banished the phrase “Im not doing that, I'm just the designer” from my conversations and it has made me a much stronger designer with a more holistic understanding of the project.
            
Play
Sometimes, I’ll start with the silliest solution in order to arrive at an innovative idea. That one great solution might come from a bunch of nonsensical solutions. Delightful design always requires some playfulness from both the designer and the product.
            <br>
            
            
            I'm always kicking around a little side-hustle or creative project. I've been enjoying freelance work recently. </p>
        
                <h3 align = "left"> What keeps me busy</h3>

        <p align = "left">

In school, my student organizations keep me busy. I am always talking about the latest project, or hackathon I’m working on for MedLaunch. We design assistive tech for disabled people.


Wolverine Media Group, is my other org, where I'm creative director for the business agency for the school newspaper. We provide strategic student led solutions for local and national businesses.</p>
