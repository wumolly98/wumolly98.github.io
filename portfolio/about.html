          <h3> We love food
          </h3>
          <p>This is Molly and Matt’s guide to getting started cooking. We don’t have culinary degrees but we love food and love cooking for ourselves. 
             <br><br>Growing up, we learned how to cook dinner for our family and many dishes from scratch. In college, we were surprised by our roommates’ and friends’ intimidation in the kitchen. So we’ve put together all the tips, tricks, and favorite dishes that have gotten us through school. We hope to help our friends get creative in their own kitchens and never have to eat microwaved soggy frozen veggies or dry, unseasoned chicken breast again.

            We love cooking for ourselves and we love helping our friends learn how to feed themselves beyond frozen veggies and pre-made stuff.
             <br><br>Follow us for everything from basic tips on cooking meat and stocking your own kitchen, to all the recipes that have gotten us through college so far. 
            
            We’ll show you how to cook steaks, make marinades, make salads, soups, curry, dumplings, and a bunch of other stuff that doesn't require extravagant ingredients or gadgets that you don't have in your college kitchen.
